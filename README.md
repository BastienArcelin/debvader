# DebVAder: Deblending galaxies with Vatiational Autoencoders

This repo contains the scripts to use the deblending algorithm based on variational autoencoders presented in [https://arxiv.org/abs/2005.12039](https://arxiv.org/abs/2005.12039). It is pip installable and can be used exclusively (for now) on images generated by the [LSST DESC DC2 simulation](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2010.05926.pdf).

## Example
An example of the application of debvader on DC2 images is presented in [this tutorial](https://github.com/BastienArcelin/debvader/blob/main/tutorials/deblending_dc2_images.ipynb).

## Installation

It requires few packages to work:
- tensorflow == 2.1.0
- tensorflow-probability == 0.9.0
- numpy
- matplotlib
- pandas
- jupyter

It can then be pip installed with
``` 
pip install debvader 
```
